# Chess Game Player

# This program is a chess game player that uses the minimax algorithm to
# determine the best move for the computer to make. The program uses the
# chess module to represent the chess board and pieces. The chess module
# can be found at https://pypi.org/project/python-chess/.

# similar to zold_chess_game_player.py but with more general game action search including the players in zold_game_tree.py that use the minimax algorithm
# should have options for players that use the minimax algorithm, the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, and the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables, and MCTS with UCT

# should interact with chess_engine.py that uses game_action_search.py to play chess games with itself and with other players. Train using neural_network_training.py

# this file is for chess (others would be made for checkers, etc.)
